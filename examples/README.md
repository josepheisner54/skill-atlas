# Examples

This directory contains sample data and scripts demonstrating how to work with skill node data. `path_of_exile_nodes.json` was generated from the official [Path of Exile skill tree export](https://github.com/grindinggear/skilltree-export) and includes a few sample nodes. `poe_nodes_example.py` shows how to load the JSON into a Python dictionary.
